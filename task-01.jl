#= Source: Unfold Documentation
Since, Deconvolution works on continuous data, to compare it to the “normal” use-case, we have to epoch it. 
Data cleaning is doing in the fuction definition 
We additionally remove trials from unfold.X that were removed during epoching 
=#
beta, times = Unfold.epoch(data=data, tbl=events, τ=(-0.3, 0.5), sfreq=128) # cut the data into epochs

beta[:,:,isnan.(events.sac_vmax)] .= missing # to run with sac_vmax

# Special solver solver_lsmr_b2b with b2b regression

# depending on unfold version, you might not be able to use the named argument, but have to put solver_b2b(x,y,1)
se_solver = solver = (x, y) -> Unfold.solver_b2b(x, y,cross_val_reps = 5)


# Generate Designmatrix & fit mass-univariate model (one model per epoched-timepoint) 
model, results_expanded = Unfold.fit(UnfoldLinearModel, f, events, beta, times, solver=se_solver)

include("dev/Unfold/src/plot.jl") # install Makie first, also run ]dev --local Unfold   to get a "local copy" of Unfold in the folder ./dev/Unfold

plot_results(results_expanded,layout_x=:basisname) # the layout_x is needed because group=nothing and the plotting function doesnt like that...

#--- didnt look further than that, but noticed I havent implemented B2B for 2D data yet (necessary for deconvolution) - but it should be very simple to do.

# select a channel? Is it necessary?plo
